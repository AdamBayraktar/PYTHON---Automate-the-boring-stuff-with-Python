Hello,
here you can see how I explored the book.
There are a lot of mini tiny projects but I told myself that I would add and I did it.
So you can see my projects from the book and compare with yours.
There were created folder for each chapter like "Chapter 1" which is equivalent to chapter 1 from book and contains all project from that chapter. Of course some irrelevant/very trivial projects were omitted. I found projects to do in the middle of chapters as well as in the questions in the end of each chapter. The ones inside were listed as in the book and those in the question, I listed as question with the corresponding question number.
Feel free to add any suggestions/comments etc.
( Yes, I know. You can't find all projects because I haven't finished the book yet. I wrote like I finished book because I wanted to have cool readme :D)
Best Regards,
Adam Bayraktar

Hello,
here you can see how I explored the book.
There are a lot of mini tiny projects but I told myself that I would add and I did it.
So you can see my projects from the book and compare with yours.
Feel free to add any suggestions/comments etc.
( Yes, I know. You can't find all projects because I haven't finished the book yet. I wrote like I finished book because I wanted to have cool readme :D)
Best Regards,
Adam Bayraktar
